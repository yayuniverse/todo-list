# todo list app

Created this to practice code organization in JS via ESM, webpack and npm

The UI layer is missing some functionality that's currently present at the app layer like
- Creating a Todo
- Deleting a Todo
- Editing a Todo
- Changing todo status
- Deleting a Project (this is currently not available in the underlying app but seems relatively trivial to add)

I'll probably never revisit this as it has served its purpose ❤️
